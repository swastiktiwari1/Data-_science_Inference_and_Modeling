Exercise 1. Polling - expected value of S
Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion p of voters are Democrats and 1−p are Republicans. Your sample size is N=25. Consider the random variable S, which is the total number of Democrats in your sample.

What is the expected value of this random variable S?

Possible Answers
E(S)=25(1−p)
E(S)=25p  (Correct)
E(S)=sqrt(25p(1−p))
E(S)=p


Exercise 2. Polling - standard error of S
Again, consider the random variable S, which is the total number of Democrats in your sample of 25 voters. The variable p describes the proportion of Democrats in the sample, whereas 1−p describes the proportion of Republicans.

Exercise 3. Polling - expected value of X-bar

Exercise 5. se versus p
Write a line of code that calculates the standard error se of a sample average when you poll 25 people in the population. Generate a sequence of 100 proportions of Democrats p that vary from 0 (no Democrats) to 1 (all Democrats).

Plot se versus p for the 100 different proportions.

Use the seq function to generate a vector of 100 values of p that range from 0 to 1.
Use the sqrt function to generate a vector of standard errors for all values of p.
Use the plot function to generate a plot with p on the x-axis and se on the y-axis.


# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p=seq(0,1,length.out=100)
#print(p)

# Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average
se=sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)

# Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis
plot(p,se)


Exercise 6. Multiple plots of se versus p
Using the same code as in the previous exercise, create a for-loop that generates three plots of p versus se when the sample sizes equal N=25, N=100, and N=1000.

Your for-loop should contain two lines of code to be repeated for three different values of N.
The first line within the for-loop should use the sqrt function to generate a vector of standard errors se for all values of p.
The second line within the for-loop should use the plot function to generate a plot with p on the x-axis and se on the y-axis.
Use the ylim argument to keep the y-axis limits constant across all three plots. The lower limit should be equal to 0 and the upper limit should equal the highest calculated standard error across all values of p and N.

# The vector `p` contains 100 proportions of Democrats ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# The vector `sample_sizes` contains the three sample sizes
sample_sizes <- c(25, 100, 1000)

# Write a for-loop that calculates the standard error `se` for every value of `p` for each of the three samples sizes `N` in the vector `sample_sizes`. Plot the three graphs, using the `ylim` argument to standardize the y-axis across all three plots.
for (n in sample_sizes){
  se<-sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
  plot(p,se,ylim=c(0,0.5/sqrt(25)))
}

Exercise 9. Standard error of the spread
Say the actual proportion of Democratic voters is p=0.45. In this case, the Republican party is winning by a relatively large margin of d=−0.1, or a 10% margin of victory. What is the standard error of the spread 2X¯−1 in this case?

Instructions

Use the sqrt function to calculate the standard error of the spread 2X¯−1.

# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters
p <- 0.45

# Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console.
2*sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)



Exercise 10. Sample size
So far we have said that the difference between the proportion of Democratic voters and Republican voters is about 10% and that the standard error of this spread is about 0.2 when N=25. Select the statement that explains why this sample size is sufficient or not.

This sample size is sufficient because the expected value of our estimate 2X¯−1 is d so our prediction will be right on.
This sample size is too small because the standard error is larger than the spread.      (Correct)
This sample size is sufficient because the standard error of about 0.2 is much smaller than the spread of 10%.
Without knowing p, we have no way of knowing that increasing our sample size would actually improve our standard error.
